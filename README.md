basic python concepts for data science

#Hi Folks,

I wrote these simple python basic concepts which are essential for data science and machine learning concepts.I referred to different online python courses and collected bits and pieces which are easy to understand. 

I divided this into 3 modules 

1)basics 

2)data structures 

3)programing fundamentals

It helps both beginners and people who want to refresh important concepts quickly

1)use anaconda jupyter notebook

2)Download the all the 3 modules

3)copy and paste all the code

4)try to understand the comments and execute line by line to see how it is working

5)on the go, use online sources to understand detailed explanations for the concepts 

Thanks,
anantha
